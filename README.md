# Suitcase handle:
Recently a friendâ€™s suitcase handle broke and he asked me to make him a new one to save him from buying a new suitcase. 
The design is based on measurements from a generic no-name Chinese suitcase.
It incorporates a button for adjusting the length of the telescoping tubes, includes nut pockets for smooth surfaces and optional spring pockets for models that need more resistance for the button.

You can 3d print it (at home or order it in a nearby 3d fab) using typical PLA material and 0,20mm layer thickness (use the .stl files).
***Check if your suitcase meets the measurements before printing (image bellow and included pdf)***.

You will also need *2 M4 screws of 25 mm length* and *2 M2 screws of 25mm* length for the assembly.

Step file is included in the folder "step file" for modifications.
